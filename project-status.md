- ✅ Step 2: Authentication Implementation completed
- Ready to proceed with Step 3: Workout Logging and API Integration

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: Supabase Setup (Completed ✅)

#### Understanding & Approach

1. **Supabase Client Integration**
   - ✅ Installed Supabase client libraries (@supabase/supabase-js and @supabase/ssr)
   - ✅ Created separate clients for browser and server-side operations
   - ✅ Created files: `lib/supabase/client.ts` and `lib/supabase/server.ts`

2. **Database Schema**
   - ✅ Created 6 main tables with lowercase names (PostgreSQL best practice):
     - users: Store user profiles and preferences
     - workouts: Track individual workout sessions
     - available_exercises: Pre-defined exercise library
     - workout_exercises: Link exercises to workouts
     - sets: Store individual set data
     - daily_volume: Track daily workout volumes
   - ✅ Added performance optimization indexes
   - ✅ Implemented data integrity with foreign key constraints

3. **Stored Procedures**
   - ✅ Created and tested 3 key functions:
     - update_user_stats: Update user's total volume and workout count
     - get_total_volume: Retrieve user's total volume
     - get_volume_by_day: Get volume data for charts

#### Implementation Steps Completed

1. ✅ Verified Supabase project setup and environment variables
2. ✅ Installed required Supabase packages
3. ✅ Created Supabase client configuration files
4. ✅ Executed database table creation scripts
5. ✅ Added performance optimization indexes
6. ✅ Seeded initial exercise data with 8 common exercises
7. ✅ Created and tested stored procedures

#### Key Decisions & Observations

1. **Database Naming Convention**
   - Initially encountered issues with case-sensitive table names
   - Switched to lowercase naming convention (PostgreSQL best practice)
   - All table and column names use snake_case

2. **Type Safety**
   - Created comprehensive TypeScript types in `lib/supabase/types.ts`
   - Implemented strict type checking for all database operations
   - Added proper CHECK constraints for enums (gender, unit_preference, theme_preference)

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Implemented CASCADE deletion for related records
   - Added UNIQUE constraints where needed (e.g., user email, exercise name)
   - Used UUID for most primary keys, SERIAL for daily_volume

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Added indexes for frequently queried columns:
     - workouts(user_id)
     - workouts(created_at)
     - daily_volume(date)

5. **Initial Data**
   - Seeded 8 common exercises covering major muscle groups
   - Each exercise includes primary and optional secondary muscle groups

6. **Dependency Management**
   - Resolved peer dependency conflicts using --legacy-peer-deps
   - Need to address date-fns version conflict in future updates

#### Verification
- Created comprehensive verification script (`scripts/verify-setup.ts`)
- Successfully verified:
  - Table creation and structure
  - Initial exercise data seeding
  - Stored procedure functionality
  - Basic CRUD operations

#### Challenges & Learnings
1. **PostgreSQL Case Sensitivity**
   - Lesson: Always use lowercase for PostgreSQL identifiers
   - Impact: Required schema redesign but improved maintainability

2. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - Issue: date-fns version conflict with react-day-picker
   - Solution: Used --legacy-peer-deps as temporary fix
   - Future: Plan to update react-day-picker or find alternative

3. **SQL Execution**
   - Challenge: Cannot execute arbitrary SQL via Supabase client
   - Solution: Used SQL editor in Supabase dashboard
   - Learning: Better control over schema changes through dashboard

#### Next Steps
1. Implement authentication system using Supabase Auth
2. Create API routes for data operations
3. Connect frontend components to real data
4. Implement form validations with Zod
5. Add proper error handling and loading states

### Step 2: Authentication (Completed)

#### Implementation Summary

1. **Authentication Components**
   - ✅ Email/password authentication with validation
   - ✅ Google OAuth integration
   - ✅ Email verification flow with 24-hour expiry
   - ✅ Session management with 7-day expiry
   - ✅ Protected route middleware
   - ✅ Type-safe auth hooks and context

2. **Security Features**
   - ✅ HTTPOnly cookies for session storage
   - ✅ IP-based rate limiting
   - ✅ Single active session per user
   - ✅ Mandatory email verification
   - ✅ Industry-standard password requirements
   - ✅ Optional 2FA support (ready for implementation)

3. **Files Created/Modified**
   - `contexts/auth-context.tsx`: Supabase auth integration
   - `app/auth/page.tsx`: Auth forms and Google OAuth
   - `app/auth/verify/page.tsx`: Email verification page
   - `app/auth/callback/route.ts`: OAuth callback handler
   - `middleware.ts`: Route protection and redirects

#### Key Implementation Details

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Sign up requires email verification
   - Login redirects to home page
   - Google OAuth uses popup flow
   - Protected routes redirect to auth page

2. **Session Management**
   - 7-day session duration
   - Single active session
   - Auto-logout on session expiry
   - Session persistence across refreshes

3. **Rate Limiting Rules**
   - Sign in: 5 attempts per IP per 15 minutes
   - Password reset: 3 attempts per email per hour
   - Email verification resend: 3 attempts per email per hour
   - API endpoints: 100 requests per IP per minute

#### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Session Handling**
   - Challenge: Managing session state across pages
   - Solution: Implemented Supabase's SSR helpers with proper cookie management

2. **Route Protection**
   - Challenge: Protecting routes while allowing auth callbacks
   - Solution: Created middleware with specific matchers and exclusions

3. **Type Safety**
   - Challenge: Maintaining type safety with auth state
   - Solution: Created comprehensive types for user profiles and auth state

#### Testing Completed
- ✅ Email signup and verification
- ✅ Password-based login
- ✅ Google OAuth flow
- ✅ Session persistence
- ✅ Protected route access
- ✅ Rate limiting functionality
- ✅ Error handling scenarios

#### Next Steps (Step 3)
