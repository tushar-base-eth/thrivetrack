### Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

"The simplest workout tracker with Fitbod-inspired design and flexibility."

## Current Status

- Frontend UI/UX components completed with mock data
- ✅ Step 1: Supabase Setup and Database Configuration completed
- Ready to proceed with Step 2: Authentication Implementation

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: Supabase Setup (Completed ✅)

#### Understanding & Approach

1. **Supabase Client Integration**
   - ✅ Installed Supabase client libraries (@supabase/supabase-js and @supabase/ssr)
   - ✅ Created separate clients for browser and server-side operations
   - ✅ Created files: `lib/supabase/client.ts` and `lib/supabase/server.ts`

2. **Database Schema**
   - ✅ Created 6 main tables with lowercase names (PostgreSQL best practice):
     - users: Store user profiles and preferences
     - workouts: Track individual workout sessions
     - available_exercises: Pre-defined exercise library
     - workout_exercises: Link exercises to workouts
     - sets: Store individual set data
     - daily_volume: Track daily workout volumes
   - ✅ Added performance optimization indexes
   - ✅ Implemented data integrity with foreign key constraints

3. **Stored Procedures**
   - ✅ Created and tested 3 key functions:
     - update_user_stats: Update user's total volume and workout count
     - get_total_volume: Retrieve user's total volume
     - get_volume_by_day: Get volume data for charts

#### Implementation Steps Completed

1. ✅ Verified Supabase project setup and environment variables
2. ✅ Installed required Supabase packages
3. ✅ Created Supabase client configuration files
4. ✅ Executed database table creation scripts
5. ✅ Added performance optimization indexes
6. ✅ Seeded initial exercise data with 8 common exercises
7. ✅ Created and tested stored procedures

#### Key Decisions & Observations

1. **Database Naming Convention**
   - Initially encountered issues with case-sensitive table names
   - Switched to lowercase naming convention (PostgreSQL best practice)
   - All table and column names use snake_case

2. **Type Safety**
   - Created comprehensive TypeScript types in `lib/supabase/types.ts`
   - Implemented strict type checking for all database operations
   - Added proper CHECK constraints for enums (gender, unit_preference, theme_preference)

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Implemented CASCADE deletion for related records
   - Added UNIQUE constraints where needed (e.g., user email, exercise name)
   - Used UUID for most primary keys, SERIAL for daily_volume

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Added indexes for frequently queried columns:
     - workouts(user_id)
     - workouts(created_at)
     - daily_volume(date)

5. **Initial Data**
   - Seeded 8 common exercises covering major muscle groups
   - Each exercise includes primary and optional secondary muscle groups

6. **Dependency Management**
   - Resolved peer dependency conflicts using --legacy-peer-deps
   - Need to address date-fns version conflict in future updates

#### Verification
- Created comprehensive verification script (`scripts/verify-setup.ts`)
- Successfully verified:
  - Table creation and structure
  - Initial exercise data seeding
  - Stored procedure functionality
  - Basic CRUD operations

#### Challenges & Learnings
1. **PostgreSQL Case Sensitivity**
   - Lesson: Always use lowercase for PostgreSQL identifiers
   - Impact: Required schema redesign but improved maintainability

2. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - Issue: date-fns version conflict with react-day-picker
   - Solution: Used --legacy-peer-deps as temporary fix
   - Future: Plan to update react-day-picker or find alternative

3. **SQL Execution**
   - Challenge: Cannot execute arbitrary SQL via Supabase client
   - Solution: Used SQL editor in Supabase dashboard
   - Learning: Better control over schema changes through dashboard

#### Next Steps
1. Implement authentication system using Supabase Auth
2. Create API routes for data operations
3. Connect frontend components to real data
4. Implement form validations with Zod
5. Add proper error handling and loading states

### Step 2: Authentication (In Progress)

#### Understanding & Approach

1. **Authentication Requirements**
   - Email/password authentication with industry-standard password requirements
     - Minimum 8 characters
     - At least one uppercase letter
     - At least one lowercase letter
     - At least one number
     - At least one special character
   - Google OAuth integration only (keeping MVP focused)
   - Mandatory email verification
   - Single active session per user
   - IP-based rate limiting for enhanced security

2. **Implementation Components**
   - Supabase Auth configuration in dashboard
   - Client-side authentication components
   - Server-side session validation
   - Protected route middleware
   - Type-safe auth hooks and contexts

3. **User Flow**
   - Sign up with email/password or Google
   - Mandatory email verification (24-hour link expiry)
   - Sign in with verified credentials
   - Password reset functionality (24-hour link expiry)
   - Session management (7-day expiry)
   - Sign out handling

#### Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Configure Supabase Auth in Dashboard
   - Enable email/password provider with password requirements
   - Set up Google OAuth with provided client ID and secret
   - Configure email templates for verification and reset
   - Enable mandatory email verification
   - Configure session settings (7-day expiry, single session)
   - Set up rate limiting rules

2. [ ] Create Authentication Components
   - Sign up form with password validation
   - Sign in form with rate limit handling
   - Google OAuth button
   - Password reset request form
   - Email verification notice
   - Loading and error states

3. [ ] Implement Server-side Auth
   - Session validation middleware
   - Protected API routes
   - Server-side redirect logic
   - Rate limiting implementation

4. [ ] Set up Client Auth Context
   - User session state
   - Authentication methods
   - Loading states
   - Error handling

5. [ ] Add Protected Routes
   - Dashboard protection
   - Settings page protection
   - History page protection
   - API route protection

6. [ ] Create Auth Hooks
   - useAuth hook for session access
   - useProtectedRoute for client-side protection
   - useSignIn for authentication
   - useSignUp for registration
   - useSignOut for logout

#### Key Decisions & Rationale

1. **Authentication Providers**
   - ✅ Google OAuth only
     - Rationale: Most common provider, reduces complexity for MVP
     - Already have client ID and secret ready
   - ❌ Other providers deferred
     - Can be added based on user demand post-MVP

2. **Security Settings**
   - ✅ Mandatory email verification
     - Ensures valid user emails
     - Reduces spam accounts
   - ✅ 24-hour verification link expiry
     - Industry standard
     - Balances security with user convenience
   - ✅ IP-based rate limiting
     - Prevents brute force attacks
     - Limits API abuse
   - ✅ Single active session
     - Simpler session management
     - Better security control
   - ❌ Remember Me functionality
     - Not needed for MVP
     - 7-day session provides good balance
   - ❌ Password history
     - Unnecessary complexity for MVP
   - ❓ Optional 2FA
     - Will implement as optional feature
     - Users can enable if desired

3. **Session Management**
   - 7-day session expiry
     - Industry standard for web applications
     - Good balance between security and convenience
   - Automatic session invalidation on password change
   - Clear session handling on sign out

4. **Rate Limiting Rules**
   - Sign in: 5 attempts per IP per 15 minutes
   - Password reset: 3 attempts per email per hour
   - Email verification resend: 3 attempts per email per hour
   - API endpoints: 100 requests per IP per minute

#### Implementation Priorities
1. Basic email/password authentication
2. Google OAuth integration
3. Email verification flow
4. Session management
5. Rate limiting
6. Optional 2FA

#### Questions Resolved
- ✅ OAuth Providers: Google only
- ✅ Email Verification: Mandatory with 24h expiry
- ✅ Session Duration: 7 days
- ✅ Multiple Sessions: Not allowed
- ✅ Rate Limiting: Implemented
- ✅ Password Requirements: Industry standard
- ✅ Remember Me: Not needed
- ✅ Password History: Not needed
- ✅ 2FA: Optional feature
